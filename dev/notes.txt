pull request to fix monotone_containts -> monotone_constraints. all over the place

in https://github.com/jdb78/pytorch-forecasting/blob/master/pytorch_forecasting/models/temporal_fusion_transformer/sub_modules.py some dtypes are float some are float32 -> same thing but inconsistent

in https://github.com/jdb78/pytorch-forecasting/blob/master/pytorch_forecasting/models/temporal_fusion_transformer/sub_modules.py line 87 it could just be nn.init not torch.nn

figure out about timeseriesdataset 

should probably figure out ^ first 

figure out trainer
https://github.com/Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning/blob/master/src/lightning/pytorch/trainer/trainer.py

trace shape of tensors though the tft, one step at a time. this probably should happen after I figure out how the timeseriesdataset work,
before the pl trainer




make get_config take a number to match model

do quantile area on graphs

figure out whats happening for predict 

understand quantile loss
